- The Data Subsystem block will be responsible for organizing and storing information into a register file (RF) indexed from 0 to 15 by a 4-bit address. It will perform ALU operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and move. Additionally, the Data Subsystem will simultaneously connect blocks to each other by selecting signals through MUX gates and corresponding activation bits to load and transmit information.
- The Control Subsystem block functions like an algorithmic flowchart, directing data flowâ€”for example, determining which registers will store the values of Kp, Ki, and Kd, and specifying the order of operations. The core of the Control Subsystem consists of micro-instructions, which are divided into two types: arithmetic micro-instructions and conditional branch micro-instructions. These micro-instructions control the operation of the ALU, the RF register file, and the MUX signal selectors to ensure efficient and accurate execution.
